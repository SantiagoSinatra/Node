# Node.js Projects for Learning and Studying Node. Mk.1
This is a group of small projects that I am building mainly with Express and MongoDB along my path of reinforcing the knowledge that i have in Node.js. These projects could be useful for people starting to learn node and for people that already have some knowledge. Some of this apps were done following tutorials that are free I'll put the links below if you want to check them.
## Getting Started
This repository is divided in folders that contain diferent apps or diferent stages of the same app. Most of the projects have comments on each line of the code explaining what they do. For each folder you will need to install Express and the requested packages that are at the top of each file.
## Links to the videos I followed to make some of the apps

## Interesting stuff on this repo
- Check out App8, its an airline flights manager API built with Express.js and Joi. Basically it lets you Create, Read, Update and Delete information from a 'database' of fake airlines.
- node-express-mongo-rest-api-app is a research CRUD app woriking with Atlas MongoDb and Mongoose.
## Extra Notes
This project is still a WIP therefore it will be updated with more advanced content soon :)
